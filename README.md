# Club Los Paltos(CLP)

**Volunteer Project<br />Contact: Marcelo Piña or Julio Piña**

Club Los Paltos (CLP) is a fully responsive HTML prototype built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Designed entirely from scratch, CLP manages 65% of its Spanish content through multiple object arrays. These arrays process data by applying specific conditions and functions, dynamically updating designated HTML elements with new innerHTML content. This methodology enables Club Los Paltos to update and maintain its website independently, eliminating the need for developer involvement. With object arrays, new data can be easily added as straightforward entries without requiring coding changes. Additionally, the prototype enhances the project by integrating a reservation center powered by Google's latest scheduling tool.

Google's new appointment scheduler is a straightforward tool that allows others to book time with you through Google Calendar. For Club Los Paltos, I integrated this tool to enable users to reserve time for tennis, padel, or events. In the prototype, I embedded just one calendar, but for this project, having three separate calendars would be ideal—one for each activity. 

To manage reservation details (such as name, email, and phone number), I incorporated the Sheets2GCal Google extension. This tool lets you import appointments directly into Google Sheets. The basic plan is free and provides [raw data](https://jennplaza.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sheets2gcal_rawdata.png), which can be customized using simple functions. For example, I used the filter function to isolate reservations for January. Then, I cleaned up the data using the split function, added a total count (to determine the number of reservations for the month), and transformed the information into a [formatted table](https://jennplaza.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/formattedtable-clp.png).

Making a reservations through this prototype will not be officially registered with Club Los Paltos.
